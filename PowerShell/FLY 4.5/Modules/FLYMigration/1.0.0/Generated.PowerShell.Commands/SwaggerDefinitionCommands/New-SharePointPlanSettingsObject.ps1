.SYNOPSIS
    

.DESCRIPTION
    

.PARAMETER PolicyId
    the id of migration policy

.PARAMETER Schedule
    the schedule for the migration

.PARAMETER NameLabel
    Large migration projects are often phased over several waves, each containing multiple plans. 
To easily generate migration reports for each project or wave, we recommend the Example name format Business Unit_Wave_Plan

.PARAMETER DatabaseId
    the id of migration database

.PARAMETER PlanGroups
    

.PARAMETER MigrationMode
    The High Speed method is recommended for most migrations. Large volumes of files and folders can be quickly migrated into Office 365. Content is first sent to Azure storage, then imported into Office 365. Properties, metadata, and site structure are migrated directly using the client-side object model (CSOM). No need to bring your own Azure - we use the default Office 365 storage. If you have additional security requirements, configure your own Azure storage location. 
The Classic method is only recommended for limited migration scopes, or for customers in datacenters that do not have access to Microsoft's Migration APIs (e.g. 21Vianet). This method migrates data directly to Office 365 using the client-side object model (CSOM). All sites, site structure, security, properties, and settings are migrated in addition to your content libraries.
